        The survey is not a test, but a self-reflective tool. It can help you better understand your
        own mindset and how it relates to global citizenship, intercultural understanding, and
        social responsibility.

        Take a few minutes to complete the survey and explore your results—you may discover new
        perspectives on how you connect with the wider world.
